# CryptoCheck -- 
## a simple app for checking cryptocurrency prices & news items

* Using plain html/js/css, fetches prices and news headlines + blurbs about the crypto-coins that I currently own

* Uses this api for both prices and news items (as it's free, public and easy to use): https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/

* Todo list: 

..1. Register/login functionality; letting the user choose the coins whose prices they want to see

..2. Better styling/responsiveness for the app (with Bootstrap or similar)
